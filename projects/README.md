Projects
==========================================================

I did these projects while developing this code.  I will add more commentary about them later.

## General structure

I make a project directory with a name like FIRST or GPIO, under that directory I make a directories to hold the code and the eclipse workspace.  I name the code directory after the project, e.g., first or gpio, and the workspace as wkspc.

I save the code generated by STM32CubeMX in the code directory, switch the workspace directory in eclipse to the appropriate location and import the project.

# first

# printf

# usart

# shell

# trace

# gpio

# i2c

See the [i2c.md](i2c.md) file for more information.
